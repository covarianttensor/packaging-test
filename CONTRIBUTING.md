### Reporting a Bug Report or Requesting a Feature
We utilize a template to keep our issue tracker organized. Please fill it out and remove areas that are not related to your Bug Report or Feature Request. Also keep these guidelines in mind as well:

* Search before posing to avoid duplicates
* Please keep the topic of the issue or feature request to **ONE** problem or request.
  * This will help our contributors keep the issues tracker organized.
* Please fill out the areas of the template you are using. Delete the parts you are not using.
* Make sure title is short but useful. It should echo the description.
  * `Add a "New Data not saved" confirmation` is a good example of a title.
* Tell us how to reproduce the bug in clear, numbered steps.
  * If we can't reproduce your bug, we will have to ask more questions. Please answer promptly, otherwise your Bug Report may stall.
* For Feature Requests, Ask yourself these questions before you post:
  * What are the advantages to having this Feature?
  * How will it benefit CasterSoundboard's work flow?
  * What will be the challenges to adding this feature?
  * Do you have any mockups or examples from other programs which implement this?
